### What I learned

First of all, I had never opened a Figma file before this challenge. To be honest, I assumed it would be as simple as just clicking to open it—until I actually googled it. I had never encountered Figma in an educational environment, so I wasn’t sure where to start. Fortunately, you provided both a Figma file and an article, which turned out to be a great step-by-step guide. That was the first boost of motivation I needed to continue with the project.

I learned that the design guide in Figma is incredibly useful for setting up fonts, colors, and overall design consistency. It helped me structure my styling choices effectively.

To better understand the code structure for a card element, I conducted some research. I didn’t have issues implementing it, but I did run into questions regarding the Figma file. For example, someone mentioned that spacing measurements in Figma shouldn't always be followed exactly in code. In my case, the div with the class "inner-container" had different spacing than what was shown in the original Figma file. Another student told me not to rely too much on Figma’s spacing measurements, but I can’t recall the exact reasoning—probably because I’m writing this report two weeks after finishing the challenge.

For styling, I decided to use raw CSS instead of a framework. I felt that focusing on foundational CSS skills was more beneficial at this stage. While I have worked with Bootstrap before, I wanted to practice and refine my understanding of design principles without relying on a framework.

I know that in my next project, I’ll come across new challenges and questions, and I’ll be more than happy to ask this community for help again.

Thanks in advance for reviewing my report!


### Continued development

Honestly, at this point, I just need to keep going—continuing to practice Flexbox and Grid while improving my understanding of Bootstrap. Eventually, I want to start using React as well. I'm sure you'll be hearing from me in the coming weeks with more questions!

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools] (https://www.w3schools.com/) - I looked up how to come up with a card structure.
- [Chat Gpt](https://chatgpt.com/) - Used it for a number of questions, like: 'how to setup my live page in github, and other things of that nature, things that helped me to get up and running.
- [Frontend Mentor blog](https://www.frontendmentor.io/articles/figma-for-developers-how-to-work-with-a-design-file-m6CZKZ1rC1) - This is the article about Figma and how to use it.
